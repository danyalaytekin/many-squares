# many-squares

Hosted on GitHub Pages at https://danyalaytekin.github.io/many-squares/.  The built code is committed to `docs` rather than something like `dist` so that it can be served by GitHub Pages.

## Getting started

Clone the repo, and then:

```
brew install nvm
nvm install
npm install
npm run build
open docs/index.html
```

## Configuration

- `options.sideLength`: the length of each side of each square
- `options.squareCount`: the number of squares to be shown
